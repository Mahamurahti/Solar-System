                    <p className={styles.description}>
                        This project was done as the final project of a 3D-modeling and mixed reality course for
                        Metropolia UAS. The goal of the project was to make an application that somehow utilized 3D
                        objects, panorama images, 360 images, XR (extended reality) elements or photogrammetry. We
                        decided to go with a web application where the user can explore a 3D Solar System. The project
                        was designed to be more educational in nature so we decided to add interesting facts and
                        information about the objects in our Solar System.

                    <h2>Sources</h2>
                    <p className={styles.description}>
                        The project had many inspirations and sources, from which we took ideas from. Our main inspiration
                        was from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXzqSAt3UIw" className={styles.link}
                        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Youtube video</a> by Wael Yasmina who created a working Solar System with
                        Three.js. After this we tried to make the scene our own by adding more objects and making them
                        interactable, which we did by ourselves. We also wanted a functional camera to the scene and
                        decided to add Tween.js into the fold. Tween.js allowed us to make really nice transitions
                        between celestial bodies and description fades. The descriptions were taken from Wikipedia and
                        NASA. We looked for potentially interesting facts and information that might interest some people.

                        <b>The Solar System isn&apos;t completely to scale</b> even though distances and sizes are roughly
                        calculated according to astronomical units. Some exceptions are the Sun, which is literally so
                        big it would cover up too much of the scene, and the gas giants. <b>Not all moon are
                        present</b>, since we only added moon we could find textures for. The same reason applies for
                        the numerous trans-Neptunian dwarf planets except Pluto.
